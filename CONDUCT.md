# VanJS Code of Conduct

VanJS is dedicated to providing a safe and comfortable environment for everyone, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, religion, or age. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form â€“ this includes jokes made about the aforementioned qualities of personhood, even when made ironically.

If someone asks you to stop behaviour that is perceived as inappropriate, leave them alone, or to end a conversation, do just that. The conversation is now over.

Harassment includes deliberate intimidation, stalking or following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any VanJS presentation or sponsorship material. 

Participants, speakers, volunteers, or sponsors violating these rules may be warned, sanctioned, expelled, or banned from the event at the discretion of [the organizers](https://www.meetup.com/vancouver-javascript-developers/members/?op=leaders). If you have a problem that requires mediation, find one of them, they are happy to help.
