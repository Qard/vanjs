# vanjs
An open-sourced home for [VanJS](http://www.vanjs.com/), the Vancouver JavaScript Developers meetup 👩🏽‍💻👨🏼‍💻

We're currently working to put VanJS more in the hands of the community, starting with documenting some of our approaches and thinking on how the meetup works, and getting a more open and collaborative talk selection and scheduling system going.

Have suggestions, thoughts, or input? We've been chatting on Spectrum: https://spectrum.chat/vanjs
