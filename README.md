# vanjs
An open-sourced home for [VanJS](http://www.vanjs.com/), the Vancouver JavaScript Developers meetup 👩🏽‍💻👨🏼‍💻

We're currently working to put VanJS more in the hands of the community, starting with documenting some of our approaches and thinking on how the meetup works, and getting a more open and collaborative talk selection and scheduling system going.

We have a **[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cambiecollective/vanjs/blob/master/SPEAKING.md)**. It's short and sweet, so please give it a read.

**Proposing a Talk**: We have a **[Speaking at VanJS Guide](https://github.com/cambiecollective/vanjs/blob/master/SPEAKING.md)**! Check it out, then propose a talk you'd like to share with the group.

Have suggestions, thoughts, or input? We've been [chatting on Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat/vanjs).
